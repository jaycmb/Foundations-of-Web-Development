                <h2>Status Quo</h2>

                <p>The population of our planet is reaching unsustainable levels as excessive consumption of resources like food, fuel and water exceeds Earth´s capacity. But this has not stopped us from depleting our planet. On August 1st, 2018, Humanity had already consumed more natural resources in 2018 than the Earth could regenerate that year. To put it in another way, humans are using natural resources 1.7 times faster than earth can generate. Rich countries are consuming 10 times more than poor countries, twice as much as the world average. Over two-thirds of our natural resources use, return into the atmosphere as Green House Gas emissions. Yet our demand on natural resource, is projected to double by 2050. If we continue like this it is inevident that the quality of life for us and our future generations cannot be preserved.</p>

                <p>
                        Resources are currently managed incredibly inefficient, in a way that is not only devastating for the environment but at the same time negatively effects the economy and our own wellbeing. Realizing this critical impact, we envision a world, where human demand on natural resources use can be tremendously reduced through the principles of circular economy together with the introduction of innovative urban design. 
                        Both production and urban structures should be designed in a way to maximize the usage potential of raw materials & products and thereby minimize waste creation in the first place. 
                        Design is oriented to use materials in a way that they can be reused instead of being transformed in a irreversible way
                        Resources, seen as valuable assets rather than waste, remain flowing through the eco-system.
                        And each and everyone of can make an impact by (sometime little, sometimes bigger ;)) changes of our daily behaviour.

                            Roughly one third of the food produced in the world for human consumption every year gets lost or wasted.
                            To put an end to this it is crucial to  foster an awareness of how food is an indispensable, important resource deserving of conscious use.
                            Food supply chains have to become more efficient, aligning producers and consumers needs more effieciently.
