                <h2>Status Quo</h2>

                <p>The population of the planet is reaching unsustainable levels as it faces shortage of resources like water, fuel and food. But this has not stopped us from depleting earth resource. On August 1st, 2018, Human had already consumed more natural resources in 2018 than the Earth can regenerate that year. To put it in another way, humans are using natural resources 1.7 times faster than earth can generate. Rich countries are consuming 10 times more than poor countries, twice as much as the world average. Over two-thirds of our natural resources use, return into the atmosphere as Green House Gas emissions. Yet our demand on natural resource, is projected to double by 2050â€¦</p>
