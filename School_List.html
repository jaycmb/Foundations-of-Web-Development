    <h1>How We Remember The Web</h1>
        
    <p style="max-width:400px"> 
        These are the stories of our first memories of when networked computers touched our lives. 
        It’s good to realize that this thing that’s been a part of life 
        for so long is the same thing we can take part in building today.

            I’d <b style="color:white; background-color:coral">loved</b> computers for a long time, ever since I was introduced to them in grade school. Classrooms had old Macs in them where you could do <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_matrix_printing">dot-matrix printing </a> and play Oregon Trail. We used them to draw and to learn. I stayed fascinated for years, but it was one day when I was 12 years old that my neighbor friend told me they got the internet. I had heard about the internet, that it connected you to information and that you could find pages about anything you could think of. I called him up and asked if I could come over. When I got there we ran straight upstairs to the office and sat down. He connected and the modem made all its weird sounds and then he opened up Netscape and I watched the first webpage load in slowly. Yahoo. There was the funny logo with the exclamation point. The list of blue links. There were categories for all kinds of things. We spent the next 4 hours clicking from category to category and from page to page, seeing what kinds of wild sites we could find. That evening I started my campaign of annoying my parents to death to get a computer for our home and it had to be one that could connect to the internet.
